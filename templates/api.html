<p>In the following, the available REST services are described. There are 3 services available: <code>closest-concepts</code>,
<code>get-vector</code>, and <code>get-similarity</code>.</p>


<h2>Get Vector</h2>
<p>This service allows you to receive the numeric vectors for a certain lemma.<br/>General structure of the REST call:</p>
<pre><code>[GET] /rest/get-vector/<var>&lt;data_set&gt;</var>/<var>&lt;concept_name&gt;</var></code></pre>
<h3>Parameters</h3>
<p>
<ul>
    <li><code>data_set</code><br/>The data set you want to query. Available values are:</li>
    <ul>
        <li><code>wordnet</code></li>
        <li><code>wiktionary</code></li>
        <li><code>babelnet</code></li>
        <li><code>alod</code></li>
    </ul>
    <li><code>concept_name</code><br/>The name of the concept you want to query for. If the concept cannot be found, the response will be empty. You do not need to ask for URIs, you can
    enter normal words like in the Web UI example.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Example</h3>
In the following, an example is given for the concept <it>sleep</it> on data set <it>wiktionary</it>.
<pre><code>[GET] /rest/get-vector/<var>wiktionary</var>/<var>sleep</var></code></pre>
When fired, the server will return the answer in JSON format where the vector is an array of floating point numbers:

<h2>Get Similarity</h2>
<p>This service allows you to receive the numeric vector similarity for two given lemmas.<br/>General structure of the REST call:</p>
<pre><code>[GET] /rest/get-similarity/&lt;data_set&gt;/&lt;concept_name_1&gt;/&lt;concept_name_2&gt;</code></pre>
<h3>Parameters</h3>
<p>
<ul>
    <li><code>data_set</code><br/>The data set you want to query. Available values are:</li>
    <ul>
        <li><code>wordnet</code></li>
        <li><code>wiktionary</code></li>
        <li><code>babelnet</code></li>
        <li><code>alod</code></li>
    </ul>
    <li><code>concept_name_1</code><br/>First concept for the similarity computation. If the concept cannot be found, the response will be empty. You do not need to ask for URIs, you can
    enter normal words like in the Web UI example.</li>
    <li><code>concept_name_2</code><br/>Second concept for the similarity computation. If the concept cannot be found, the response will be empty. You do not need to ask for URIs, you can
    enter normal words like in the Web UI example.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre><code>[GET] /rest/get-similarity/<var>alod</var>/<var>king</var>/<var>queen</var></code></pre>
<p>When fired, the server will return the answer in JSON format where the similarity is returned as a floating point number:
